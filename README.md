<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>This project aims to optimize marketing campaigns for a sportswear brand in the UK market. We analyze A/B testing results to understand the effectiveness of different ad strategies, including customer segmentation, ad formatting, and platform selection.</p>

<h3 id="data-methodology">Data and Methodology</h3>

<p>The analysis utilizes data from an A/B testing experiment conducted on a dataset of 67,085 advertisements. Three key tests were performed:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Customer Segment Optimization:</strong> Compared ad performance based on targeting specific audience segments (interests, custom audiences, lookalikes) vs. a broader audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Formatting & Interactivity:</strong> Evaluated the effectiveness of video and interactive ads compared to non-video, non-interactive ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Platform Placement:</strong> Analyzed the success rate of ads automatically placed by Meta vs. those manually placed by the advertiser.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ab-testing-results">A/B Testing Results</h3>

<h4>Customer Segment Optimization</h4>
<p>Group 1A Success Rate:   89.47%    (17/19)â€‹
Group 1B Success Rate:   70.00%    (175/250)â€‹
z-statistic: 1.8104â€‹
p-value: 0.0702â€‹
Confidence Level:  92.98%</p>

<h4>Ad Formatting & Interactivity</h4>
<p>Video and interactive ad formats lead to a significantly higher success rate compared to non-video, non-interactive ads.</p>

<h4>Automatic Platform Placement</h4>
<p>While manual platform placement might offer a slight advantage, the difference is not statistically significant.</p>

<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>

<p>Based on the findings, we recommend the following actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Prioritize Targeted Marketing:</strong> Invest in audience research and refine targeting strategies to reach relevant demographics.</li>
    <li><strong>Emphasize Engaging Formats:</strong> Utilize video and interactive elements to capture user attention and drive conversions.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider Manual Platform Selection:</strong> Evaluate the benefits of manual placement for specific campaigns, particularly based on historical data.</li>
</ul>
